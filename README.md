## Game Instructions
The goal of this game is to pick up all five objects around you and correctly in trash or recycling.  Objects will start at randomly generated points.  If they are placed into the correct bin, they will stay there and your score will increase, as shown by the scoreboard.  If you place an item in the wrong bin, it will go to a new random location on the map.

## Why did you make this?
I made this project as a way to build sustainable habits.  The idea for this project came to me when I was walking through Rand Dining Center and looked at observed how people used the trash cans and the recycling.  People will put anything in recycling if there isn't a trash can nearby while also putting a lot of what could be recycled into a trash can.  This stems from a combination of both laziness and knowledge.  On a larger scale, the world as a whole struggles to recycle items.  Waste is generally undesired and there's only so many places to put our waste.  It doesn't take much research or much time to realize that this is an issue.  Though I don't feel like I need to say too much about why we should recycle, it's important to restate the need.  Reducing how much we consume has lots of positive benefits.  Also, our current trends of consumption aren't sustainable.  I made this as a game to add fun and reduce the physical toll associated with doing something that can sometimes be seen as a menial task.


## Why is VR a good medium to achieve your goals?
VR is a great medium for my goals because it allows users to act in a environment that is easy to set up and to control.  This game allows users to practice picking up items and throwing them away or recycling them.  VR allows for this task to be done anywhere and by anyone.  The biggest advantage of using VR is the realism.  In VR, one of the most impactful things people do is to grab virtual objects with their real hands.  The simple act of grabbing an object is significant.  This game seeks to use that to make users realize the impact of recycling in the format of a game.  Ideally, users won't have to play this game for long until they realize that this is something that they can do in real life and make a true impact.  My hope is that gamifying this will allow for increased engagement and interest.  As discussed below, physical actions are easier to do in VR than in real life.  This can serve as a gateway however.  Someone who sees the physical barriers to recycling can easily overcome these in VR.  After lowering the barriers to entry to begin recycling, users will hopefully form impactfu habits that will carry into real life.  Personally, through making this game, I've thought much more about what I can do to pick up trash and recycle more.


## Critiques or limitations of VR?
As mentioned above, VR is nothing compared to reality when it comes to doing good.  Actually picking up trash or recycling things is much better in real life than in VR.  VR also struggles with the action of reaching down and picking up items, depending on the setup of the sensors used to detect the hand controls.  VR also doesn't accurately represent physical actions well.  For example, picking up a watermelon is just as easy as picking up an empty soda can.  Even bending down to pick something up can be done easily.  Movement is controlled through a couple of joysticks.
